## GitHub Documents

This is an R Markdown format used for publishing markdown documents to GitHub. When you click the **Knit** button all R code chunks are run and a markdown file (.md) suitable for publishing to GitHub is generated.

## Including Code

You can include R code in the document as follows:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


```{r}
plot(cars)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```


```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r}
health_full <- read_csv("https://chronicdata.cdc.gov/api/views/6vp6-wxuq/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD")

```


```{r}
heath_ca <- filter(health_full, StateAbbr == "CA")

```
